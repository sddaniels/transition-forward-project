This self-assessment is designed to help you determine where your organization
sits right now, and what areas might be good to focus on improving. If you find
many areas, that's okay, we all have to start somewhere. If you don't, that's
great news! But don't take it as a certification that your organization is
perfect. There are no perfect scores or failing grades, it isn't that kind
of test. The results are completely private and only for you and your teammates
to use and interpret.
