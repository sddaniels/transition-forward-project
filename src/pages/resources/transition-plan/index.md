Generally someone transitions at work because there is some aspect of how they interact with others at work that
they would like to change. This could be as simple as a pronoun change (for example: from "he" to "they"), or it
could involve many aspects over a significant amount of time. Transition planning is complex because each
and every transgender and non-binary person is different, as is each workplace and team that they work in.
Regardless, it's important to have a plan so that changes go smoothly during what is most likely a very stressful time.

## Transitioning

Consider all of these aspects that may change during a person's transition (not an exhaustive list):

- Name
- Pronouns
- Voice pitch, cadence, and word choices
- Physical appearance
- Manner of dress
- Mannerisms
- Habits
- Facilities usage
- Interests
- Group membership
- Physical strength
- Friends and family
- Living situation
- Time required away from work
- Medically (not necessarily surgery)
- Legally

That said, it's important to remember that transitioning does not affect one's intelligence or job competency.

## Planning

### Questions

- Are your organization's policies flexible enough to handle the fact that transitioning people will have different journeys and preferences?
- How will the transition be communicated to the necessary parties?
  - Who should be informed?
- How will leadership set expectations for employee behavior during and after a transition?
- What are ways to reduce the burden on the transitioning individual?
  - Option not to be present during an announcement
  - Offer to make sure that the transitioning individual is not along during intimidating situations such as the first step into an office after coming out
  - Have any relevant email signatures, badges, names, gender markers, photos, etc. updated ASAP according to the plan
- If the transitioning individual works with any external parties, how will they come out to those parties?
  - Consider: customers, clients, vendors, contractors, media contacts, regulators, other tenants in a shared office space
  - Will the transitioning individual have strong backing from the company?
  - How would you handle harassment from an external party?
  - How would you handle an employee that feels like a transitioning person might "look bad" to an external party?

## "Post"-Transition

In a lot of ways, transitioning never really ends. Transgender and non-binary folks are constantly meeting new people and encountering new
situations that may require them to decide whether to disclose their history, how to disclose it, and the best way to do it. Even if they choose not to
disclose anything, they may still need to deal with the after effects of these situations. This can be especially true if one has
encountered transphobia.

### Questions

- How can you make sure that a transitioning person continues to feel included and supported weeks, months, and years later?
- How can you prevent tokenism that takes advantage of an employee for the organization's benefit?
