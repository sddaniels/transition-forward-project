Workplace policies are a necessary part of any functioning organization, but for
transgender and gender non-conforming folks they can have a huge and lasting
impact. Well considered and implemented policies can be a source of validation
and safety for those transitioning. On the other hand, policies that don't
consider or reflect the needs of trans employees can be actively harmful.

Creating new policies that are targeted towards a certain group can
be a touchy subject. You may find that existing and more general policies can often be
extended to cover the specific needs of transgender and gender non-conforming
employees.

## Facilities Access

Employees should be able to use the facility that corresponds to their gender
identity.

### Questions
- Do you have any all-gender or single occupancy bathrooms or changing rooms in your space? How many are there and where are they?
- Do all employees know that they shouldn't question anyone's right to be in a bathroom or locker room?
- How will you handle an employee and/or other tenants of a building that are uncomfortable with a transgender or gender non-conforming individual using the bathroom?
- If you have any employees that go out into the field or into other people’s homes, how will you accommodate their bathroom and other facility needs?

## Discrimination, Bullying, and Harassment
Existing policies and laws that apply to your workplace almost certainly state
that discrimination, bullying, and harassment are not tolerated. Transgender employees
are interested in whether these policies cover them as well, and whether your organization's
leadership and HR Department will have their back.

### Questions
- What are the state and local laws that affect transgender people where your employees work?
- Is gender identity considered a protected class? (In Iowa, the answer is **yes**)
- If your organization has multiple locations, do these laws vary across locations?
- What is covered by your policies in terms of transgender and gender non-conforming individuals?
  - Is intentional and repeated misgendering (using the incorrect pronouns or name) considered harassment?
  - Is questioning someone’s right to be in a bathroom or locker room considered harassment?

## Dress Code

Transgender and gender non-conforming employees should be allowed to wear clothing
that matches their gender identity and expression.

### Questions
- What is your dress code? Are all parts of the dress code necessary for employees to perform their job functions?
- If you have a gender specific dress code, is it possible for you to make it gender neutral?

## Employee Privacy

Coming out, or the ongoing process of sharing one’s sexual orientation or gender identity with others, should be strictly
in control of the individual who is coming out. This doesn't apply only to those transitioning in your workplace &mdash;
people that have already transitioned may be keeping the fact that they are transgender private.

### Questions
- What policies can potentially cover your employees in terms of the of privacy of their gender identity, status as transgender, and/or sexuality?
- What are the company policies and laws that keep medical information private?
  - Asking about medical procedures or private parts should be off limits.
  - Over-sharing can cause problems as well when a precedent is set for other employees feeling like they need to share details of their own medical situation (trans or otherwise)

## Gender Marker Change
Gender marker changes can be complicated and time consuming because there is no one
system of record in the United States. There are often roadblocks depending on the state
of residence or birth, and non-binary folks often don't have a choice of gender marker
that accurately reflects their identity.

  <strong>Note:</strong>
  Many organizations still refer to "Sex" markers instead of "Gender" markers.

### Questions
- Are you aware of the many different places in which a trans individual may need to change their gender marker?
  - State ID and/or driver's license
  - Passport
  - Social Security Administration
  - Birth Certificate (not possible in several states)
  - Insurance
- Which internal systems need to be updated by HR after a gender marker changes? What is the system of record for that change (e.g. state ID)?
- What are the requirements for you to inform your health insurance company that a gender marker has changed?
- If non-binary markers are available for your employees, such as "X", how will your systems and health insurance company handle it?
- If an employee cannot change a gender marker in a certain way, how will you be able to accommodate them?
- Are there any systems that can be updated without a legal gender marker change?
- Have you considered asking for pronouns as a part of employee onboarding and providing a mechanism to change them later?

## Name Change

Many, although not all, transgender employees will decide to change their name to
more closely align with their gender identity.

### Questions
- Legal name changes can be difficult, costly, and take a long time. Which internal records can be updated without a legal name change? Think about:
  - Badges and name tags
  - Staff directories and photos
  - Email addresses and signature blocks
  - Business cards
  - Physical nameplates on offices and desks
  - Instant messaging programs such as Slack
- Do you already let employees use nicknames or shorter versions of their legal name at work? Would a trans individual's request be treated differently?
- Do you make it harder for trans individuals to change their name than you would someone getting married and changing their name?
