Employer provided benefits play a vital role in the lives of many transgender
and transitioning people. Not all individuals will choose to transition medically,
but for those that do, access to affirming care through insurance is necessary for their
safety and happiness. This is not a short-term need since those that have transitioned will
generally continue to require periodic trans-related care for the rest of their lives.

The stakes here can be very high. People experiencing untreated [Gender Dysphoria](https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/gender-dysphoria/what-is-gender-dysphoria)
can suffer intense psychological distress. If a workplace doesn't provide needed coverage
it can keep a candidate from accepting a job offer, cause a valued employee to look
for another job, or worse.

  not have single-payer health coverage, employers commonly provide health insurance coverage.

## Health Insurance

Transgender employees and dependents need access to medical care for many of the
same reasons others do, but they may also need access to one or more types
of medically necessary treatment related to their transition. This treatment is
supported by [many medical organizations](https://transcendlegal.org/medical-organization-statements)
and outlined in the [WPATH Standards of Care](https://www.wpath.org/publications/soc).

### Questions
- What is your insurance carrier's clinical policy bulletin on transgender care?
See examples at [Transcend Legal](https://transcendlegal.org/health-insurance-medical-policies).
- Even if your carrier has a bulletin, does your insurance policy contract contain
any coverage exclusions or limitations for transgender-specific treatment?
- If there are coverage exclusions or limitations, will your insurance company treat
a person's transgender status as a barrier to unrelated care?
- If your contract does not specifically exclude or affirm coverage, are you able
to reach out to an experienced benefits manager to determine available coverage?
- Do you need an explicit rider to your contract that affirms coverage?
- Do HR staff know the details of the coverage that is available or where to find that
information when asked?
- Do employees and interviewing job candidates know what coverage is available to them through your organization?
- Is there anything you can do as an organization to make the process of seeking care
easier for those transitioning? For instance, can you assign a company advocate to help
navigate insurance requirements and push back on denials of coverage?
- What does your insurance plan specifically cover?
  - Mental health coverage
  - Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT)
  - Lab work for maintaining correct hormone levels
  - Hair removal via electrolysis and laser
  - Voices lessons and voice therapy
  - Gender affirming surgeries
      - Top surgery (mastectomy or breast augmentation)
      - Bottom surgery (hysterectomy, phalloplasty, orchiectomy, vaginoplasty, etc.)
      - Facial feminization or masculinization surgery
      - Vocal modification surgery
      - Hair transplants

## Medical Leave

Many transitioning individuals will need time away from the workplace in order to
deal with their transition. This could include something as simple as taking a
mental health day due to dysphoria or it could be an extended leave to deal with
recovery from a major surgery.

### Questions
- Does your medical leave policy cover medical treatment as a part of a gender
transition?
- Do you allow employees to work from home when necessary?
- Trans individuals may not wish to disclose details about why they are not
at work if it's transgender-related. Have you created a culture where employees
aren't required or expected to justify leave with personal details?
