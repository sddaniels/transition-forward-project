Sometimes the hardest part of supporting transgender and non-binary
employees is simply knowing where to start. We're here to help! But you may be
surprised that this collection of resources isn't what you expected.

Every individual and every company is different, and that goes for every workplace transition too. For
that reason we felt that a sample policy or strict guidelines were the wrong approach.
There just isn't a one-size-fits all solution. Don't be discouraged though, we're all in the
same boat together as we learn! As a community we'll help you do the work to find approaches
that are flexible enough for your organization and your employees.

**So let's grab our work boots and get started!**
