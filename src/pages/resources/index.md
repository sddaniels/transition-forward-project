Sometimes the hardest part of supporting transgender and gender non-conforming
employees is simply knowing where to start. We're here to help! But you may be
surprised that this collection of resources isn't what you expected when you
first made your way here.

If you were thinking you'd dig into a set of strict guidelines or even a sample
policy that you could cut and paste, well, you won't find those. We could do
that but it almost certainly wouldn't work out well for us or for you! There
just isn't a one-size-fits all solution. Every individual and every company
is different, and that goes for trans folks too.

Don't despair though! We're all in the same boat together as we learn. As each
of us experiences successes and failures we discover a piece of the puzzle.
Eventually common themes emerge and give us topics to think about and questions
to answer. Only you can put in the work to find solutions that are flexible
enough for your organization and your employees.

**So let's grab our work boots and get started!**
